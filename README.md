# oblivious

This small app lets you create a Twitter feed that only shows the raw tweets of the people you follow (nothing else).

### Motivation

I want to see tweets from a couple people without dealing with Twitter (trending section, annoying replies, seeing what my followers "like", etc). This is exactly what this website does. I named it oblivious because I'd rather be oblivious to what is trending and the random annoying opinions of people that somehow creep into my twitter feed (like when someone I follow likes a tweet of someone I don't follow and still shows up somehow).
