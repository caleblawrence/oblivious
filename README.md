# oblivious

This is an ongoing project. I currently have a couple people I have hardcoded but I would like to expand this site so that there is auth and peoplel can add their own followers.

### Motivation

I want to see tweets from a couple people without dealing with Twitter (trending stuff, annoying replies, seeing what my followers reply to, etc). This is exactly what this website does. I named it oblivious because I'd rather be oblivious to what is trending and the random annoying opinions of people that somehow come into my twitter feeds (like when someone I follow likes a tweet of someone I don't follow and still shows up).
